# Conway's Game of Life

A derivation of Conway's game of life. Tries to conform as much to the rules as possible, but 
prints out multiple species of animals. 

Rules:
* Track 8 neighbor animals
* If there are less than two neighbors or more than three neighbors the animal will die.
* If there are three neighbors the animal will return to life.
* Neighbor animal types don't matter.


I made this for fun to learn a bit more about the Rust programming language.

# Getting Started
See game instructions by running `cargo run -- --help`.

Enjoy!
